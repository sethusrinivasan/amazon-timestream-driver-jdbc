    <!--The proper solution to this issue would be using Prepared Statement to construct
    a pre-compiled SQL query, and currently the driver does not support Prepared Statement,
    so the exclude is added.
    This is not a new exclude, as it has already been added for populateCurrentRows for
    TimestreamTablesResultSet in this file.-->
